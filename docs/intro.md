# Introduction to OCC

Welcome to the tutorial for **OCC** (Open Computational Chemistry) - a powerful quantum chemistry toolkit for molecular and crystal structure calculations.

OCC provides:
- **Self Consistent Field (SCF)** calculations with Hartree-Fock (HF) various Density Functional Theory (DFT) approximations (B3LYP, PBE, etc.)
- **Wavefunction analysis** and visualization tools, like calculating electron density grids, electrostatic potential etc.
- **Crystal structure analysis** including convergence of lattice/binding energies for molecular crystals and isosurfaceevaluation and  properties
- **Multi-platform support** native binaries on mac, linux, windows, python bindings, web version powered by wasm

## What You Can Do with OCC

Use it as a command line executable ([try it out](/try))!

Use it as a python package!

Use it in the web browser!


## Getting Started

This tutorial series will guide you through:

1. **Basic SCF Calculations** - Some quick quantum chemistry calculation with water
2. **Wavefunction Analysis** - Visualizing electronic structure, MOs and more
3. **Estimate Binding energies of molecular crystals** - Understanding molecular crystals
4. **Crystal Growth & Morphology** - Predicting crystal shapes
5. **Advanced Features** - Web integration and interactive visualization
